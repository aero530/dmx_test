//! Messages passed between tasks.
//!
//! These are the vocabulary of the event router: every task either produces or
//! consumes them. They live here rather than beside the tasks that send them
//! because the router and the channels are target-agnostic, while the tasks
//! themselves are not — a task signature names a concrete `Spi`, `I2c` or
//! `Input`, but the message it sends does not.
