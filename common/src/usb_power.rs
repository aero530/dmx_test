//! Shared state for the USB-brick LED power path (board U14 TPS2553-1).
//!
//! Three parties touch this and none of them can hold a lock across an await
//! on the other core, so it is a set of atomics rather than a mutex:
//!
//! - the **router** publishes the `LED Power` setting whenever settings load
//!   or change,
//! - the **button task** (core 1, owns the TCA9555) drives `USB_LED_EN` on P04
//!   and publishes what it reads back from P05/P06/P07,
//! - the **LED task** reads the mode plus the enable state to decide whether
//!   the brightness budget applies, and the **UI** reads it for the title row.
//!
//! Board reference: EN is active-high with a 100 k pull-down (R38), so the
//! path is off until firmware drives P04 high. FAULT (P07) is open-drain and
//! pulled up (R35): **low means the switch has latched off** after an
//! overcurrent or a reverse-voltage event, and it only re-arms when EN is
//! toggled.
