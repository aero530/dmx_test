//! Front-panel buttons, read through the TCA9555 — polled.
//!
//! Polled rather than interrupt-driven: the expander's `INT` line used to sit
//! on GP28, which the Rev 2 carrier now spends on the FT232RNL USB-DMX port
//! (GP28 is the only UART0 TX that was not already committed). At 50 Hz a poll
//! is one 3-byte I²C transaction (~80 µs at 400 kHz) every 20 ms, well under
//! 1 % of the bus, and it buys two things the interrupt never gave for free:
//! debounce by construction (a 20 ms sample spacing is longer than any tactile
//! switch bounces), and no interrupt latch that can fail to re-arm.
//!
//! The poll doubles as core 1's watchdog check-in (`supervisor.rs`).
//!
//! The press/release state machine and the emit-on-release behaviour are
//! deliberately identical to the STM32 build's `button_row_task`, so the router
//! and UI see exactly the events they saw before.
