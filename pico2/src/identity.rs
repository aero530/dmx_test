//! Per-unit identity from the RP2350's factory chip ID.
//!
//! Two things must differ between units that are otherwise byte-identical:
//!
//! - the **USB serial-number string** — a host that sees two devices with the
//!   same serial treats them as one, and Windows reuses the COM-port binding,
//!   so two boxes on one PC would fight over a port;
//! - the **MAC address used until the EEPROM has one programmed** — two
//!   unprogrammed boards on one bench would otherwise collide.
//!
//! Both derive from the 64-bit chip ID burned into OTP at the factory. It is
//! unique per die and needs no provisioning step, which is the point: a unit
//! straight off the assembly line is already distinguishable.
