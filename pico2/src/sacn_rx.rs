//! sACN / E1.31 receiver.
//!
//! Runs alongside the Art-Net task and writes into the same `DMX_BUFFER`, so
//! the router and everything downstream are unchanged.
//!
//! # Why multicast is the point
//!
//! Art-Net's ingest problem is that broadcast traffic arrives whether it is
//! wanted or not — a console pushing 32 universes costs SPI bandwidth even if
//! only four are ours. sACN puts each universe in its own multicast group, so
//! joining only the ones in use lets an **IGMP-snooping switch drop the rest
//! upstream**. They never reach the W6300 at all. That is a better answer than
//! unicast Art-Net, which still has to arrive before it can be discarded.
//!
//! # Universe numbering
//!
//! sACN universes are 1-based and unrelated to Art-Net Port-Addresses, so the
//! node has its own `sacn_universe` setting: universe *base* lands in buffer
//! slot 0, *base + 1* in slot 1, and so on for the `DMX_UNIVERSE_COUNT` slots
//! the buffer holds. The router renders from slot 0 in `sACN` mode, so the
//! LED page's universe offsets read directly as "universes above the base" —
//! the same mental model as Art-Net, just with the base spelled as one number.
//!
//! Only the groups for that window are joined, and they are re-joined when the
//! base changes. Joining every possible group would defeat the purpose, since
//! the switch would then forward everything.
