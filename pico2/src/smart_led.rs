//! WS2812 / SK6812 output — eight strings, one PIO state machine each.
//!
//! PIO does the 800 kHz one-wire timing directly and DMA feeds it, so the CPU
//! cost per frame is packing the pixels into words (`ws2812.rs`).
//!
//! # State machine allocation
//!
//! Fixed here so the other PIO users do not have to negotiate for slots:
//!
//! | Block | SM0 | SM1 | SM2 | SM3 |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | PIO0 | *W6300 SPI transport* | string 1 | string 2 | string 3 |
//! | PIO1 | string 4 | string 5 | string 6 | string 7 |
//! | PIO2 | *DMX in* | *DMX out* | string 8 | spare |
//!
//! All three blocks hold the same 4-instruction WS2812 program; the state
//! machines within a block share it, which is why eight strings fit at all.
//!
//! # Colour mode
//!
//! The colour buffer is always RGBW. Each frame is packed for the configured
//! mode — 24-bit GRB for WS2812-class strips, 32-bit GRBW for SK6812-class —
//! so switching modes on the menu needs no re-initialisation. Only the
//! configured LED count is transmitted, so a 100-LED string refreshes in a
//! sixth of the time a 600-LED one does.
//!
//! # Why the strings are joined rather than awaited in turn
//!
//! Each `write` is DMA-backed and yields until its transfer completes. Awaiting
//! them sequentially would make the frame time the *sum* of eight strings
//! instead of the longest one — 144 ms rather than 18 ms at 600 LEDs. They are
//! joined so all eight clock out concurrently.
