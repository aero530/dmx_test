//! TCA9555 16-bit I²C I/O expander — front-panel buttons and the TFT's static
//! control lines.
//!
//! Four register pairs, so a driver rather than a dependency.
//!
//! | Port | Bits | Function on the Rev 2 carrier |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 0 | 0..=3 | buttons Down / Up / Select / Esc (inputs, active low, J6) |
//! | 0 | 4..=7 | spares on J7 (inputs) |
//! | 1 | 0 | TFT `RES` (output) |
//! | 1 | 1 | TFT `CS` (output, held low — the panel is alone on SPI1) |
//! | 1 | 2..=7 | spares on J7 (inputs) |
//!
//! # `INT`
//!
//! Not wired on the Rev 2 carrier — GP28 went to the FT232RNL UART, so the
//! buttons are polled (`buttons.rs`). The pin goes to test point TP1 only.
//! [`inputs`] still reads **both** ports in one auto-incrementing transfer:
//! it is one transaction either way, and on any board that does wire `INT`
//! that is the read that clears the latch for both ports.
//!
//! # Pull-ups
//!
//! The TCA9555 (unlike the TCA9535) has ~100 kΩ pull-ups on every input, which
//! is why the buttons are wired straight to ground with no external resistors —
//! and also why an input-configured `CS` would float *high*: the display's chip
//! select must be an output, driven low, or the panel ignores every byte.
